This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### [LIVE PROJECT](https://main--imaginative-smakager-d4b161.netlify.app/)

#### Features
- Beyond the requested landing page, I also created a toggle to make an API call to NewsAPI and dynamically fill the template. You will need a newsAPI key (provided via email from me, if this test is intended for you!).

#### Struggles
- I honestly have not used React without MUI in years, so some of the CSS might be a little bit janky but I've come to rely quite a bit on MUI.

#### Given More Time...
- Given more time, I would create media queries to make it more responsive
- I would also be less hacky with quite a bit of the code to make it more extensible... there are some components that rely on a struct being an exact format.


### Local Project:
